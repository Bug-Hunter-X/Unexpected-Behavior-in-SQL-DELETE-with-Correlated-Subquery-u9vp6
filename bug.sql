The following SQL query attempts to use a correlated subquery within a DELETE statement to delete rows based on a condition involving a join. However, it might cause unexpected behavior or errors in certain database systems:

```sql
DELETE FROM employees e
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM departments d
    WHERE d.id = e.department_id AND d.location = 'New York'
);
```

The issue is that the database might not correctly handle the correlation between the outer `DELETE` statement and the inner `SELECT` subquery.  Some database systems might optimize the query in a way that leads to unexpected side effects or errors, especially if there are concurrent updates or transactions involved.
